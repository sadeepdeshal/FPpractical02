Comparison of Java and Scala:

1. Language Paradigms:
Java: Primarily an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It supports functional programming to some extent with the introduction of lambdas in Java 8.
Scala: A hybrid language that seamlessly integrates both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.


2. Syntax:
Java: More verbose syntax.
int i = 2;
int j = 2;
Scala: Concise syntax.
var i, j = 2


3. Type Inference:
Java: Requires explicit type declaration for variables (until Java 10's var).
int m = 5;
Scala: Has powerful type inference capabilities.
val m = 5;
